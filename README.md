I am Reg Dodds @regdodds
- üå± I program well in Lisp, C, C++, Java but prefer Python.  I have taught all of them.  I have been using Lefkowitz's 
    PLUM indentation for years and now Python has strengthened my belief in that kind of indentation.  
    
-   I write my documents in LaTeX but I am trying to move to Lua, but it is a battle.  
    
-   As far as natural languages go, I am putting time into Yiddish, but have spent years trying to learn 
    Putonghua and now try to avoid dementia by using Duolingo to learn languages like Latin, Esperanto, the Germanic
    and the Romance languages, and Russian.  
    Some of the Duolingo courses are truly brilliant, especially Russian, German, French and Spanish.  
    Yiddish also lies in the top five. I never realised how close Yiddish is to German---I can follow it with little trouble.
    The Duolingo stories have recently added Italian and Japanese to their Spanish, French, German and Portuguese 
    ones.  I wish I had access to these materials when I was younger.
    
-   I am fluent only in English and Afrikaans.  
    
- üíûÔ∏è I learned functional analysis and measure theory from Kolmogorov and Fomin's two books, and have taught
     theoretical computing using Michael Sipser's outstanding book. Udi Manber wrote my favourite book on algorithms, 
     but the Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein book is a classic. Sedgewick's book is another winner for algorithms and 
     data structures.  Winston's book on AI is still a favourite, especially the chapter on searching.  When symbol 
     systems were going out of fashion we moved to Tom Mitchell's book on Machine Learning as an early reader, but 
     later concentrated on Andrew Ng's course notes as a basis for our ML courses.
     
-    I have taught people to program in Fortran, Lisp, Algol, PL/I, Prolog, Pascal, Modula II, Oberon,---but not Delphi---, 
     C, C++, Java and Python.  My first paid job was to code and maintain thousands of lines of assembly language for a salary
     system.  I then weedled my way into teaching.
     
- üì´ My emails are rdodds@uwc.ac.za, rdodds@sun.ac.za, and Reg.Dodds@mail.com
